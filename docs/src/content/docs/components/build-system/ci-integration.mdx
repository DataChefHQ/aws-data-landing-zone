The Data Landing Zone (DLZ) construct offers built-in support to streamline authentication between AWS and CI/CD
systems, enhancing security and simplifying setup processes.

## GitHub Actions

DLZ facilitates seamless integration with GitHub Actions using OpenID Connect (OIDC). OIDC is recommended over
long-lived IAM credentials due to its enhanced security and flexibility. For detailed information, refer to the
official documentation from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)
or
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws/)

We first need to configure the AWS side and then pass the generated IAM Role ARN to the GitHub Actions workflow.

### 1. Config AWS

:::note
The OIDC role has to be created before it can be used by GitHub Actions. This creates a "chicken and egg" problem and
requires manual deployment of the `management` stack. This only has to be done manually once as setup for the OIDC
integration, more details at the end of this section.
:::


The following section demonstrates how to configure OIDC integration for a sample repository.
This example uses the [DataChefHQ/data-landing-zone-example-typescript](https://github.com/DataChefHQ/data-landing-zone-example-typescript)
repository. Ensure you replace the placeholders with values specific to your setup.

<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    const dlz = new DataLandingZone(app, {
      ...
      deploymentPlatform: {
        gitHub: {
          references: [
            { owner: 'DataChefHQ', repo: 'data-landing-zone-example-typescript ' },
            // { owner: "DataChefHQ", repo: 'recipes_data-landing-zone_data-landing-zone-sandbox', filter: "refs/heads/main"}
          ],
        },
      },
    });
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
  ```python
  dlz.DataLandingZone(app,
    ...
    deployment_platform=dlz.DeploymentPlatform(
        git_hub=dlz.GitHub(
            references=[
                dlz.GitHubReference(owner='DataChefHQ', repo='data-landing-zone-example-typescript'),
                # dlz.GitHubReference(owner='DataChefHQ', repo='recipes_data-landing-zone_data-landing-zone-sandbox', filter='main')
            ]
        )
    )
  )
  ```
  </Fragment>
</DualCode>

The example above does not specify the `filter` property, which means all environments, tags, branches and PRs can
assume the generated IAM Role to authenticate with AWS. For a complete list of filters see the
[Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token)

Some common Examples:
- `environment:ENVIRONMENT-NAME` - Specific environment
- `ref:refs/heads/BRANCH-NAME` - Specific branch
- `ref:refs/tags/TAG-NAME` - Specific tag
- `pull_request` - Only PRs

A `*` can be used for most parts of the `ENVIRONMENT-NAME`, `BRANCH-NAME`, `TAG-NAME`

#### Manual setup deployment

The OIDC role created by the configuration above has to happen before it can be used by GitHub Actions. This creates
a "chicken and egg" problem and requires manual deployment of the `management` stack. This only has to be done
manually once as setup for the OIDC integration.

```bash
cdk deploy "root--global_management_*"
```

After deployment, the OIDC role ARN can be found in the `dlz-global` stack outputs with the name
`dlz-global-git-hub-deploy-role`. It will be in this format:

```
arn:aws:iam::YOUR_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID:role/dlz-global-git-hub-deploy-role
```

### 2. Use within GitHub workflows

The GitHub workflow for the given repository can now be updated to use the OIDC role ARN.
It is important to set the `permissions` so that `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4` works correctly.

This workflow can be used to do a CDK diff when a PR is opened or synchronized. It can also be triggered manually.
```yaml title=".github/workflows/diff.yml" {12-15, 26-30}
name: Diff
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  workflow_dispatch: {}
env:
  FORCE_COLOR: 1
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: CDK Diff and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: write
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install ci
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::YOUR_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID:role/dlz-global-git-hub-deploy-role
          aws-region: YOUR_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_GLOBAL_REGION
      - name: CDK diff
        run: "cdk diff \"**\""
```

This workflow can be used to do a CDK deploy when a PR is merged. It can also be triggered manually.
```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch: {}
env:
  FORCE_COLOR: 1
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: CDK Diff and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: write
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install ci
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::YOUR_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID:role/dlz-global-git-hub-deploy-role
          aws-region: YOUR_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_GLOBAL_REGION
      - name: CDK diff
        run: npm run diff
      - name: CDK deploy
        run: "cdk deploy \"**\" --require-approval never --progress events --concurrency 10"
```

It is possible to split the deployment of the `development` and `production` workload accounts and place an approval step
in the middle. This requires knowledge of the correct CDK commands to use. The example below demonstrates this.

  </summary>

  Ensure that the the `production` GitHub environment exists and is configured to require manual approval. See the
  [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/managing-environments-for-deployment#deployment-protection-rules)
  for more information.

  This workflow first builds the CDK cloud assembly and caches the assets. It then deploys the Management and Security
  Phases. Then it deploys the all the `type: DlzAccountType.DEVELOP` workload stacks. The last job deploys the
  `type: DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION` workload stacks. But this job will not start as it has the `environment: production`
  property set and will only start after manual Approval has been given on GitHub.

  Create following composable action file in the `.github/workflows` directory as it is used in the above workflow to
  prevent code duplication.

## Deployment Order

The [cdk-express-pipeline](https://github.com/rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline) package is used internally by the DLZ
construct to define waves, stages, and stacks, ensuring resources are deployed in a controlled and organized manner.
This functionality is fully abstracted, so users of the DLZ construct do not need to worry about the underlying details.

However, understanding the structure of the DLZ can be beneficial for advanced setups. For example, when separating
the deployment of `development` and `production` accounts within the workload OU, additional configuration may be
required.

The DLZ is designed to work seamlessly with any Build or CI/CD system, such as GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, or even local
execution. Deployments are straightforward, requiring only standard CDK commands. For instance, you can deploy all
resources with the following command:

```
cdk deploy "**"
```

For advanced scenarios, such as separating deployments of `development` and `production` accounts within the workload
OU, specific CDK commands must be used. This is necessary only when incorporating a manual approval step between
deployments.

For further details, refer to the [Deployment Order](deployment-order) documentation.

## CI Integration

The Data Landing Zone construct simplifies integration with CI/CD platforms by providing built-in support for
secure authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC). This approach ensures robust and streamlined authentication.

Detailed examples of how to integrate with various CI/CD systems are provided to assist users.

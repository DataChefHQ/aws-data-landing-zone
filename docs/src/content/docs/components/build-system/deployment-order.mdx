## Deployment Order

The [cdk-express-pipeline](https://github.com/rehanvdm/cdk-express-pipeline) is utilized to create Waves and Stages,
enabling the controlled deployment of resources. This enables deployments from any build
systems, like GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and even local environments.

Internally, the DLZ creates `layers`, which is a collection of `waves`. Each `layer` typically consists of a
`global` `wave` and optionally one or more `regional` `waves` which are deployed sequentially. Waves contains `stages`
which are groupings of `stacks` deployed in parallel. For the DLZ the `stage` and dependencies between `stacks` within
the same `stage` are of little importance as we rely on `waves` only.


The regions are defined in the `config`, you can only have a single Global region and optionally one or more Regions.
<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    const dlz = new DataLandingZone(app, {
      ...
      regions: {
        global: Region.EU_WEST_1,
        regional: [Region.US_EAST_1],
      },
    });
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    dlz.DataLandingZone(app,
      ...
      regions=dlz.DlzRegions(
          global_=dlz.Region.EU_WEST_1,
          regional=[dlz.Region.US_EAST_1],
          ),
      )
    ```
  </Fragment>
</DualCode>


To recap:

- `Layer` - A collection of `Waves`, this is a logical grouping only, and not implemented in code. Deployed sequentially, one after the other.
- `Wave` - A collection of `Stages`. Deployed sequentially, one after the other.
- `Stage` - A collection of `Stacks`. Deployed in parallel.
- `Stack` - A collection of ` AWS resources`. Deployed in parallel when possible as determined by stack dependencies within the `Stage`.

A brief description of the resources deployed in each layer:

- **Root Layer** - Deploys to the `root` account, resources like the Organisation's SCPs, and IAM Identity Center resources etc.
- **Security OU - Audit Layer** - Deploys to the `audit` account, resources like SecurityHub and Chatbot notifications.
- **Workload OU - Base Layer** - Deploys to each account specified under workloads. IAM roles, which is a global service, would for example be
deployed in the Global wave. While resources such as a VPCs will be deployed in both the Global and the Regional wave as per configuration.
The majority of the services are deployed in this layer.
- **Workload OU - NCP1 + NCP2 + NCP3 Layers** - NCP stands for **Network Connections Phase**, these layers are logically
numbered to indicate the order of deployment to control dependencies between accounts and regions. It will deploy
resources related to networking that require multiple steps, like VPC Peering. For example, for VPC Peering to work,
NCP1 defines the peering roles. NCP2 creates the peering connections, knowing that it can use the cross account roles
in all accounts. NCP3 creates the route table entries to allow traffic to flow between the VPCs knowing the
VPC peering connections have been established.
- **Workload OU - DSP1 Layer** - DSP is the abbreviation for **Data Services Phase**, this layer deploys resources
like Lake Formation, etc.

## Stacks

The printing of the deployment order can be controlled with the `printDeploymentOrder` flag. When set, the deployment
order will be printed as shown below. This flag is set by default.

DLZ is only using Waves and not Stages to control dependency, so let's break this down into the "Layers" of deployment
and focus on the stacks (removing the stages) that are deployed in each layer.

Each stack is identified by the `📄` symbol, and has the following format:

```
📄 <stack-name> (<stack-id>)
```

- `<stack-name>` - The name of the stack as seen in the AWS Console
- `<stack-id>` - The unique identifier of the stack that we use to target for CDK commands like diff, deploy, destroy etc.

**Root Layer**
```
🌊 root--global
    📄 dlz-global (root--global_management_eu-west-1)

## Stacks patterns

The DLZ uses stack IDs to enable precise targeting of specific stacks, allowing for controlled and efficient deployments.
Below are some commonly used patterns that can be applied with the CDK command:

- `**` - Target all stacks
- `root--*` - Target all stacks in the root layer
- `security--*` - Target all stacks in the security layer
- `workloads--*` - Target all workload stacks in all layers
- `workloads--base--*` - Target all workload stacks of the base layer
- `workloads--ncp*` - Target all workload stacks of all the NCP layers
- `workloads--ncp1--*` - Target all workload stacks of the NCP1 layer
- `workloads--ncp2--*` - Target all workload stacks of the NCP2 layer
- `workloads--ncp3--*` - Target all workload stacks of the NCP3 layer
- `workloads--dsp1--*` - Target all workload stacks of the DSP1 layer

Stacks can be targeted by global/regional waves as well, for example:
- `workloads--base--global_*` - Target all workload global stacks in the base layer
- `workloads--base--regional_*` - Target all workload regional stacks in the base layer

They can also be targeted by account type, for example:
- `*_*--development_*` - Target all stacks in the workload layer of type `development` (specified in the config by `type: DlzAccountType.DEVELOP`)
- `*_*--production_*` - Target all stacks in the workload layer of type `production` (specified in the config by `type: DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`)


### Basic deployment

The basic version deploys all the stacks of the DLZ as defined by the deployment order.

```bash
cdk deploy "**"
```

### Advanced deployment

The advance deployment deploys the layers individually, allowing for manual approval steps between the deployment of
the `development` and `production` accounts in the workload OU.

```bash
cdk deploy "root--*"
cdk deploy "security--*"
cdk deploy "*_*--development_*"

**[MANUAL APPROVAL]**

cdk deploy "*_*--production_*"
```

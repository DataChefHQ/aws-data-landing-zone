This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a once-off guide for enabling and configuring various AWS services
required for specific features in the Data Landing Zone.

## AWS Chatbot and Slack Integration

To deliver notifications to a Slack channel, a one-time account-level setup is required to integrate the Slack
Workspace with AWS Chatbot. While the Data Landing Zone (DLZ) manages the SNS topics and Slack channel configurations
using the `SlackChannel` construct, the initial Slack Workspace integration must be completed manually.

### Steps to Connect AWS Chatbot to Slack

The following steps outline the process of connecting AWS Chatbot to your Slack Workspace:

1. Open the **AWS Chatbot Console** and select Slack as your chat platform.
2. Click **Configure new client** under Slack to begin the authorization process.
3. Log in to the Slack workspace where notifications will be sent.
4. Review and approve the requested permissions for AWS Chatbot.
5. Verify the installation in Slack by locating the app under the **Apps** section.

Additional References:
- Refer to [Step 1 of the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/slack-setup.html#slack-client-setup)
for detailed instructions.

### Available Integrations

:::note
Slack is used only for one-way notifications from AWS to Slack. A default "Deny All" IAM policy is applied to the
ChatBot guardrails for enhanced security.
:::

Slack notifications can be configured for the following accounts and regions:

1. **AWS Budgets**: Requires linking the Slack Workspace in the **Management Account**.
2. **AWS Security Hub**: Requires linking the Slack Workspace in the **Security Audit Account**.
3. **Default Application Notifications**: Requires linking the Slack Workspace in each individual account.

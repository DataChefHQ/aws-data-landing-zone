Data Landing Zone (DLZ) integrates seamlessly with AWS Control Tower, complementing its functionality rather than
replacing or conflicting with it. Control Tower and AWS Organization setup must be created manually. DLZ does not
define Control Tower and accounts within CDK but instead accepts the IDs of these entities. This approach allows DLZ
to be easily integrated into both existing Control Tower configurations and new (greenfield) setups.

AWS Control Tower automatically creates two accounts, `Audit` and `Log Archive`, under the `Security` Organizational
Unit (OU). In addition to these, DLZ requires two manually created OUs: `Workloads` and `Suspended`.

## Workload OU

The `Workloads` OU is designed to house all AWS accounts according to your organization's specific needs. For instance:

- **Small Product-Based Company:**
  A smaller company might maintain only three accounts:
  - `Development` - Used for all project development, type: `DlzAccountType.DEVELOP`
  - `Stage` - Used for testing projects, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`
  - `Production` - Used for live projects, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`

- **Larger Organization:**
  A larger organization might adopt a more complex structure, including centralized tooling and network accounts as
  well as project-specific accounts. For example:
  - `Tooling` - Centralized tooling, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`
  - `Network` - Centralized network, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`
  - `Project 1 - Develop` - Project 1, type: `DlzAccountType.DEVELOP`
  - `Project 1 - Production` - Project 1, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`
  - `Project 2 - Develop` - Project 2, type: `DlzAccountType.DEVELOP`
  - `Project 2 - Production` - Project 2, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`

Each account is classified as one of the following types:
- `DlzAccountType.DEVELOP` - Accounts with fewer security restrictions, designed to enhance the developer experience.
- `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION` - Accounts requiring tight security measures, used for hosting production workloads.

To begin, follow the [SOP - Initial Control Tower Setup](/sop/initial-control-tower-setup) guide to enable Control
Tower, configure the AWS Organization, and create the required OUs. The final step,
[Gather the required information for DLZ](sop-initial-control-tower-setup#gather-the-required-information-for-dlz),
provides instructions for identifying and copying the necessary Organization ID, OU IDs, and Account IDs.

After gathering the required information, input the IDs into the DLZ CDK construct. Below is an example configuration
for two accounts in the `Workloads` OU. Additional accounts can be added as needed.

## Suspended OU

In the CDK code, workload accounts that are no longer required can be moved to the `Suspended` Organizational Unit (OU).
When an account is moved to the `Suspended` OU, no resources are deleted. All CloudFormation stacks, resources, and
data remain preserved. The account is essentially quarantined using a Service Control Policy (SCP) that blocks all AWS
API actions.

Accounts can be moved within the CDK, between the `workloads` and `suspended` OUs as shown below.

After moving an account to the `Suspended` OU, ensure that any weak references to the account and its resources are
removed. These references are commonly found in the `network` block, particularly within the `nats`, `connections`, and
`bastionHosts` sections. If these references are not cleared, the CDK will generate an error, indicating that the
entity must be removed due to the invalid reference before being able to proceed.

The `diff` and `deploy` [scripts](/reference/scripts-commands) execute an additional command after their respective CDK
operations. This command checks whether any accounts in the `Suspended` Organizational Unit (OU) have CloudFormation
stacks with names starting with `dlz-`. Such stacks indicate the presence of resources within the suspended account that
could still incur costs.

If any such stacks are detected, a warning is displayed in the console. It is the user's responsibility to review and
remove any resources that are no longer needed.

Refer to the [SOP - AWS Nuke](/sop/aws-nuke) page for instructions on how to use the AWS Nuke script and remove
resources from suspended accounts.

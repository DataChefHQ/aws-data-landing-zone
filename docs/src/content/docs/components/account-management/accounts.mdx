Data Landing Zone (DLZ) integrates seamlessly with AWS Control Tower, complementing its functionality rather than
replacing or conflicting with it. Control Tower and AWS Organization setup must be created manually. DLZ does not
define Control Tower and accounts within CDK but instead accepts the IDs of these entities. This approach allows DLZ
to be easily integrated into both existing Control Tower configurations and new (greenfield) setups.


AWS Control Tower automatically creates two accounts, `Audit` and `Log Archive`, under the `Security` Organizational
Unit (OU). In addition to these, DLZ requires two manually created OUs: `Workloads` and `Suspended`.

The `Workloads` OU is designed to house all AWS accounts according to your organization's specific needs. For instance:

- **Small Product-Based Company:**
  A smaller company might maintain only three accounts:
  - `Development` - Used for all project development, type: `DlzAccountType.DEVELOP`
  - `Stage` - Used for testing projects, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`
  - `Production` - Used for live projects, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`

- **Larger Organization:**
  A larger organization might adopt a more complex structure, including centralized tooling and network accounts as
  well as project-specific accounts. For example:
  - `Tooling` - Centralized tooling, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`
  - `Network` - Centralized network, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`
  - `Project 1 - Develop` - Project 1, type: `DlzAccountType.DEVELOP`
  - `Project 1 - Production` - Project 1, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`
  - `Project 2 - Develop` - Project 2, type: `DlzAccountType.DEVELOP`
  - `Project 2 - Production` - Project 2, type: `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION`

Each account is classified as one of the following types:
- `DlzAccountType.DEVELOP` - Accounts with fewer security restrictions, designed to enhance the developer experience.
- `DlzAccountType.PRODUCTION` - Accounts requiring tight security measures, used for hosting production workloads.

To begin, follow the [SOP - Initial Control Tower Setup](sop-initial-control-tower-setup) guide to enable Control
Tower, configure the AWS Organization, and create the required OUs. The final step,
[Gather the required information for DLZ](sop-initial-control-tower-setup#gather-the-required-information-for-dlz),
provides instructions for identifying and copying the necessary Organization ID, OU IDs, and Account IDs.

After gathering the required information, input the IDs into the DLZ CDK construct. Below is an example configuration
for two accounts in the `Workloads` OU. Additional accounts can be added as needed.

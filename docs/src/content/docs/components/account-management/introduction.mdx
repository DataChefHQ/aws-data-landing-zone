Highlight the code that is being talked about. Its not needed if it is basic/simple piece of code, but if it gets
long and complex where you have to show the imports or other configs for example that are important for the piece
of code you want to highlight and talk about.

```ts {4-5}
import * from not_important

function demo() {
  // This line (#2) and the next one are highlighted
  return 'This is line #3 of this snippet';
}
```

You can add the filename to the code block if it is important to know where the code is from.

```ts
// my-test-file.js
function demo() {

}
```

We should be displaying both the TS and Python code blocks in the same way.

We loose the nice autocomplete in our IDEs(webstorm at least), but I have not found any way to prevent it,
unfortunate, but it is what it is.

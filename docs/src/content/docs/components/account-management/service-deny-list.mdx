The Data Landing Zone supports deployment across multiple AWS regions. When configuring regions, you must define:
- **Global Region**: Also referred to as the "home region" by Control Tower, this is where Control Tower is deployed.
It hosts non-regional resources such as IAM. The global region is deployed first, as other regions may depend on
resources created there. Note: the global region should not and cannot be changed after deployment.
- **Additional Regions**: One or more regions where you wish to manage and govern resources.

:::tip
Not all [AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/region-how.html) support every resource.
It is recommended to use major regions like `eu-west-1` or `us-east-1`, which typically have comprehensive support.

Below is an example of defining a global region and one additional region.

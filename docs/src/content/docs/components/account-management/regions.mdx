The Data Landing Zone supports deployment across multiple AWS regions. When configuring regions, you must define:
- **Global Region**: Also referred to as the "home region" by Control Tower, this is where Control Tower is deployed.
It hosts non-regional resources such as IAM. The global region is deployed first, as other regions may depend on
resources created there. Note: the global region should not and cannot be changed after deployment.
- **Additional Regions**: One or more regions where you wish to manage and govern resources.


:::tip
Not all [AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/region-how.html) support every resource.
It is recommended to use major regions like `eu-west-1` or `us-east-1`, which typically have comprehensive support.

Below is an example of defining a global region and one additional region.

<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    import {App} from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    import { DataLandingZone } from 'aws-data-landing-zone';

    const app = new App();
    const dlz = new DataLandingZone(app, {
      regions: {
        global: Region.EU_WEST_1,
        regional: [Region.US_EAST_1],
      },
     ...
    });
    ```

  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import aws_cdk as cdk
    import aws_data_landing_zone as dlz

    app = cdk.App()
    dlz.DataLandingZone(app,
        regions=dlz.DlzRegions(
            global_=dlz.Region.EU_WEST_1,
            regional=[dlz.Region.US_EAST_1],
        ),
        ...
    )
    app.synth()
    ```

  </Fragment>
</DualCode>

## Adding a region

1. Add the region to Control Tower and wait for the setup/deployment to complete.
1. Update the Data Landing Zone configuration to include the new region.
1. Run the `bootstrapAll` script or manually bootstrap the account using the AWS CDK. Refer to
[Scripts and Commands](/reference/scripts-commands) for detailed instructions.

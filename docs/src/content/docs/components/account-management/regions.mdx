The Data Landing Zone supports multiple regions. You have to define:
- A global region, also referred to as the home region according to Control Tower. The global region is where
Control Tower is deployed and will be used for resources that are not region-specific like IAM. This region will
always be deployed before the other additional regions as they might depend on resources created in the global region.
Your global region can/should not be changed after it has been created.
- One or more additional regions where you want to manage and govern resources.

:::caution
Not all [regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/region-how.html) supports all resources.
It is recommended to use "major" region, both `eu-west-1` or `us-east-1` regions are usually good choices.

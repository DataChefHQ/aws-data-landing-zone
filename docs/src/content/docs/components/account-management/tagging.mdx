The Data Landing Zone implements a mandatory tagging strategy across all accounts and resources.
This ensures that resource costs can be tracked and the responsible creators can be identified.

The following AWS services are utilized to enforce an effective tagging strategy:
1. An AWS Organization Tag Policy at the account level.
2. A Service Control Policy (SCP) at the account level, which enforces that all CloudFormation (CFN) Stacks
must include these tags upon creation.
3. An AWS Config rule that checks for these tags on supported resources. While the rule does not support all
resources, it ensures that key resources, such as `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`, will inherently apply tags
to the resources they create. For more information, refer to the config rule [required-tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/required-tags.html).

:::note
It is not possible to enforce tags on all resources universally. The strategy outlined here represents
the best possible effort. The Config Rule will report any untagged resources to Security Hub, where they
can be tracked. It is then necessary to identify the responsible party and ensure the tags are applied
to the resources.

## Default Mandatory Tags

The mandatory tags all begin with a capital letter, but the underlying code property is lowercase. The mandatory tags include:
- `Owner` - Identifies the team or individual responsible for the resource.
- `Project` - Specifies the project to which the resource belongs.
- `Environment` - Defines the environment of the resource, such as `development`, `staging`, or `production`.

The DLZ construct will automatically apply the following tags to all resources it creates:
- `Owner`: `infra`
- `Project`: `dlz`
- `Environment`: `dlz`

These tag values can be customized by providing an array of values for each tag in `mandatoryTags`.
Note that while the code property is lowercase, the tags created will follow the capitalized format outlined above.

    ```ts
    import {App} from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    import { DataLandingZone } from 'aws-data-landing-zone';

    const app = new App();
    const dlz = new DataLandingZone(app, {
      mandatoryTags: {
        owner: ['backend'],
        project: ['project1'],
        environment: ['development', 'staging', 'production'],
      },
     ...
    });
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import aws_cdk as cdk
    import aws_data_landing_zone as dlz

    app = cdk.App()
    dlz.DataLandingZone(app,
        mandatory_tags={
            "owner": ["backend"],
            "project": ["project1"],
            "environment": ["development", "staging", "production"],
        },
        ...
    )
    app.synth()
    ```
  </Fragment>

## Additional Mandatory Tags

Additional mandatory tags can be added to the Data Landing Zone construct by specifying the `additionalMandatoryTags`
property.

<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    import {App} from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    import { DataLandingZone } from 'aws-data-landing-zone';

    const app = new App();
    const dlz = new DataLandingZone(app, {
      additionalMandatoryTags: [
        {
          name: 'cost-center',
          values: ['test']
        },
      ],
     ...
    });
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import aws_cdk as cdk
    import aws_data_landing_zone as dlz

    app = cdk.App()
    dlz.DataLandingZone(app,
        additional_mandatory_tags=[
            dlz.DlzTag(
                name='cost-center',
                values=['test']
            )
        ],
        ...
    )
    app.synth()
    ```
  </Fragment>
</DualCode>

## Activate Cost Allocation Tags

To activate Cost Allocation Tags, you need to either locally run the `configureCostAllocationTags` script, as
outlined in [Scripts and Commands](/reference/scripts-commands), or enable them through the AWS Management Console.
This step is essential for utilizing tags in AWS Cost Explorer and applying them as filters when setting up AWS Budgets.

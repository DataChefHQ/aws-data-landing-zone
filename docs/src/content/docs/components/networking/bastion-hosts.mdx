The Data Landing Zone provides Bastion Hosts that can be accessed via AWS SSM Session Manager. This ensures secure
access without the need for SSH keys or an open inbound port in security group rules.

To add a Bastion Host to the `network` section of the configuration, the following properties are important:
- `name`: This is optional. If not specified, it defaults to `default`. You only need to provide a name if you have
multiple bastion hosts in the same stack (account and region combination).
- `location`: Specifies the **Subnet** [Network Address](/reference/network-address) to deploy the Bastion host in.
We recommend using a private subnet to reduce the attack surface. Ensure the private subnet has internet access
through a [NAT](nats).
- `instanceType`: Defines the size of the EC2 instance. The image used will be Amazon Linux 2023.

## Allowing a resource to be accessed via the Bastion Host

The Bastion Host restricts inbound traffic to its own security group. To allow a resource to be accessed through the
Bastion Host, you must add the Bastion Host’s security group to the security group of the resource you wish to access.

For example, to access a private RDS instance through the Bastion Host, you must include the Bastion Host’s security
group in the RDS instance’s security groups.

The Bastion host security group ID can be found in the AWS SSM Parameter Store under the following path:
```
dlz/bastion/${name}/security-group/id
```

Here is an example of how this would look in CDK, as used in a Workload team's repository:
```typescript
    // Create a security group for the RDS instance
    const rdsSecurityGroup = new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'RdsSecurityGroup', {
      description: 'Security group for RDS instance',
    });
    rdsSecurityGroup.addIngressRule(c2.Peer.anyIpv4(), ec2.Port.tcp(5432));

    // Retrieve the Bastion security group ID from SSM Parameter Store, given its name is `default`
    const bastionSecurityGroupId = ssm.StringParameter.valueForStringParameter(this, 'dlz/bastion/default/security-group/id');

    // Import a construct of the Bastion Security group
    const bastionSecurityGroup = ec2.SecurityGroup.fromSecurityGroupId(this, 'BastionSecurityGroup', bastionSecurityGroupId);

    // Attach the Bastion security group to the RDS instance
    new rds.DatabaseInstance(this, 'MyRDS', {
      ...
      securityGroups: [
        rdsSecurityGroup,
        bastionSecurityGroup   <<<
      ],
      ...
    });
```

## Accessing the Bastion Host

:::tip
Ensure the Bastion host can access AWS endpoints to use AWS SSM Session Manager. This can be achieved by allowing
communication over the internet (default). Alternatively, you can configure VPC endpoints for private VPC communication
and modify the security group of the Bastion Host to allow only traffic from within the VPC.
:::

You can access the Bastion host through the [AWS SSM Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html).

The following parameters are used in the scripts:
- `PROFILE` - The AWS CLI profile to use. Omit this if you are using environment variables instead (also remove --profile).
- `EC2_BASTION_ID` - The EC2 instance ID of the bastion host. This can be found manually using the CLI or Console.
- `RDS_ENDPOINT` - The RDS endpoint to connect to.

To open an SSH session to the Bastion host:
```bash
PROFILE=""
EC2_BASTION_ID=""

aws ssm start-session \
    --profile "$PROFILE" \
    --target "EC2_BASTION_ID"
```

While accessing the Bastion host directly is useful for running commands on the host, it is typically more effective
for port forwarding to access resources within the VPC. The following command forwards local port 5432 to the RDS
port 5432, which is located in a private subnet.

```bash
PROFILE=""
INSTANCE_ID=""
RDS_ENDPOINT=""
PORT=5432

aws ssm start-session \
    --profile "$PROFILE" \
    --target "$INSTANCE_ID" \
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost \
    --parameters "{\"host\":[\"$RDS_ENDPOINT\"],\"portNumber\":[\"$PORT\"],\"localPortNumber\":[\"$PORT\"]}"
```

You can now connect to the RDS instance with a local GUI by specifying `localhost` as the address and `5432` as the port.

title: IAM Permission Boundary
description: IAM Permission Boundary
---
import DualCode from '../../../../components/DualCode.astro';

A permissions boundary uses a managed IAM policy to define the maximum permissions an
identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. This ensures that the entity can perform only actions permitted
by both its identity-based policies and the permissions boundary, effectively preventing unauthorized permission
escalation.

The Data Landing Zone enables specifying an IAM policy to be used as a permissions boundary for all IAM users and
roles. The DLZ creates a managed policy named `IamPolicyPermissionBoundaryPolicy` and enforces its attachment to all IAM
users and roles through a
[Service Control Policy](https://github.com/DataChefHQ/aws-data-landing-zone/blob/cd54815aa4c2bdc7f1ba2d91b18df914280553fb/src/constructs/organization-policies/service-control-policy.ts#L38).

The example below demonstrates a permissions boundary that allows listing S3 bucket contents (`s3:ListBucket`) and
downloading objects (`s3:GetObject`) across all S3 resources in the account. Note that the entity must also have matching
permissions in its identity-based policy to perform these actions. This policy is for demonstration purposes only, as
it has limited scope and usability.

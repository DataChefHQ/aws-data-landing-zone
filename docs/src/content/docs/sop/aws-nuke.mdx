This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidance on cleaning resources within an AWS account. The Data Landing
Zone (DLZ) includes a [script](/reference/scripts-commands#available-scripts) that utilizes a third-party open-source
tool called [AWS Nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke).

The script requires the path to the AWS Nuke binary, which is not included in the DLZ and is specific to your
architecture. It can be executed locally or integrated into a pipeline. The AWS Nuke configuration YAML file will be
generated and used by the script to execute the AWS Nuke binary.

The generated configuration file varies based on the account's Organizational Unit (OU) in the config file:
- **Workloads OU**: Will delete all resources except:
    - ControlTower resources
    - CDK Bootstrap resources
    - DLZ-defined resources
- **Suspended OU**: Will delete all resources except:
    - ControlTower resources
    - CDK Bootstrap resources

Refer to the [Account Management / Accounts](/components/account-management/accounts#suspended-ou) page for instructions
on moving an account from the Workloads OU to the Suspended OU.

## Usage

The AWS Nuke script can be used in a similar manner to the suggested script usage described in the
[Scripts and Commands](/reference/scripts-commands) page. This section provides an additional example of running
scripts in TypeScript or Python with arguments. This is one of several ways to execute the script.

1. OPTIONAL, to run and test the script locally. Download and extract the AWS Nuke binary from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke/releases) for your architecture and
save it in `scripts` folder as `aws-nuke`.
2. Add the following entries to the `.gitignore` file:
    ```bash
    scripts/aws-nuke
    scripts/aws-nuke-config.yml
    ```
3. Verify the directory structure. It should resemble the following:
    ```
    scripts/
    └── aws-nuke
    └── aws-nuke.ts           # Created in the next step
    └── aws-nuke-config.yaml  # This file will only be created when the script runs
    ```
4. Create and execute the script using your preferred programming language.
    <DualCode>
      <Fragment slot="ts">
        ```ts
        // scripts/aws-nuke.ts
        import { Scripts } from "aws-data-landing-zone";
        import { config } from "../bin/minimum_config";

        const [,, accountName, ...options] = process.argv;
        if (!accountName) {
          console.error('Error: The `accountName` argument is required. `node scripts/aws-nuke.js <accountName> [--no-dry-run]`');
          process.exit(1);
        }

        const dryRun = !options.includes('--no-dry-run');
        if (!dryRun) {
          console.log('Option `--no-dry-run` specified.');
        }

        const awsNukeBinary = './aws-nuke';
        (async () => {
          await (new Scripts()).awsNuke(config, __dirname, awsNukeBinary, accountName, dryRun );
        })();
        ```

        You can run the script using `npx ts-node`, which is typically included as a dev dependency in AWS CDK projects. To
        simplify the process, add a corresponding script to your `package.json`.

        ```json
        // package.json
        {
          "scripts": {
            "aws-nuke": "scripts/aws-nuke.ts"
          }
        }
        ```

        You can then execute the script with:
        ```
        npm run aws-nuke -- <accountName> [--no-dry-run]
        ```
        For example, to only verify what will be deleted (a dry run) on the the `development` account:
        ```
        npm run aws-nuke -- development
        ```
        For example, to delete all resources in the `development` account:
        ```
        npm run aws-nuke -- development --no-dry-run
        ```

      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="python">
      ```python
      # scripts/aws_nuke.py
      import os
      import sys
      from aws_data_landing_zone import Scripts
      from data_landing_zone_example_python.config_minimum import config

      if len(sys.argv) < 2:
          print('Error: The `accountName` argument is required. Use: python scripts/aws_nuke.py <accountName> [--no-dry-run]')
          sys.exit(1)

      account_name = sys.argv[1]
      options = sys.argv[2:]
      dry_run = '--no-dry-run' not in options

      if not dry_run:
          print('Option `--no-dry-run` specified.')

      aws_nuke_binary = './aws-nuke'

      scripts = Scripts()
      scripts.aws_nuke(config, os.path.dirname(__file__), aws_nuke_binary, account_name, dry_run)
      ```

      You can then execute the script with:
      ```bash
      python scripts/aws_nuke.py <accountName> [--no-dry-run]
      ```
      For example, to only verify what will be deleted (a dry run) on the the `development` account:
      ```
      python scripts/aws_nuke.py development
      ```
      For example, to delete all resources in the `development` account:
      ```
      python scripts/aws_nuke.py development --no-dry-run
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </DualCode>

## Build / CI Usage

The AWS Nuke binary is 200MB+ extracted and around 40MB compressed. It is recommended to let the pipeline download the
binary and place it in the `scripts` directory, otherwise Git LFS (Large File System) must be used to commit the binary.

### GitHub Workflow

This workflow can be started by going to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository, selecting the `AWS Nuke` workflow,
and providing the required inputs.

```yml

  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      account-name:
        description: 'AWS Account Name'
        required: true
      dry-run:
        description: 'Dry Run'
        required: true
        default: 'true'

We recommend adopting a Tag-Based Access Control (TBAC) strategy in Lake Formation and setting the `hybridMode` flag
to `false`, disabling IAM management.

Rather than directly assigning permissions to individual resources, this approach uses tags on resources,
and permissions are granted based on those tags to principals. This strategy simplifies data governance by significantly
reducing the effort required to set up and manage permissions, especially in large environments.

Here is a summary of the key concepts involved in Tag-Based Access Control (TBAC):

- **LF-Tags**: Key-value pairs that are attached to resources.
- **Resources**: These include databases, tables, and columns registered in Lake Formation.
- **Principals**: IAM entities (Users, Roles, AWS IAM Identity Center, SAML), AWS accounts, Organizations, and Organizational Units.
- **Grants**: Permissions given to principals for accessing resources based on their LF-tags.

## Tag-Based Access Control (TBAC)

Grants in TBAC are typically expressed as SQL statement pseudocode for easy conceptualization. These grants
ultimately translate into CloudFormation/CDK constructs. We will reason about permissions in this SQL format.

A typical Grant expression might look like this:

```sql
GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS foo=bar AND spam=eggs TO DataLakeUser
```

### Rules

LF-Tags follow a set of fundamental rules:

- Grants are applied **TO** principals **ON** specific tags. For example:

  ```sql
  GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS foo=bar TO user
    ```

- In a grant expression, all tag **keys** are evaluated using `AND` logic, while tag **values** are
evaluated using `OR` logic. For instance:


  The user has access to resources tagged with both `foo=bar` AND `spam=eggs`
  ```sql
  GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS foo=bar AND spam=eggs TO user
  ```

  The user has access to resources tagged with either `foo=bar` OR `foo=baz`
  ```sql
  GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS foo=['bar', 'baz'] TO user
  ```
- Tags assigned to resources are **inherited**, unless specifically overridden.

- Grants ensure access to resources where **ALL** conditions specified are true.

### Limitations

There are a few limitations in designing flexible tag systems:
- Tags are assigned to data catalog resources (databases, tables and columns), and each resource can
have multiple tags, with a maximum of **50 tags** and **no duplicate keys**.

- A resource cannot have the same LF-tag key more than once. For example, you cannot apply both
`team=sales` and `team=marketing` to the same table.

  One workaround is to embed the name inside the tag key, making the tag behave as a toggle, such as
  `team:sales=true` and `team:marketing=true`.

- A `GRANT` statement cannot use an `OR` condition across different tag keys. The following statement is
**invalid**:

  ❌ Invalid
  ```sql
  GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS foo=bar OR spam=eggs TO user
  ```

  ✅ Valid
  ```sql
  GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS foo=bar TO user
  GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS spam=eggs TO user
  ```


### Best Practices

Here are some best practices and recommendations to consider when designing your tagging system:

- LF-Tags are hierarchical. If you apply a `GRANT` statement to a high-level resource (like a database),
this inherently grants access to all child resources (like a table) that share the same tag value.

- When creating a `GRANT` statement, remember that tags are **AND-ed**, not **OR-ed**. For example:

  ```sql
  GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS team:marketing=true TO executives
  ```

  This grants the `executives` group access to all resources tagged with `team:marketing=true`.

  If the statement is modified to:

  ```sql
  GRANT ACCESS ON TAGS team:marketing=true AND PII=true TO executives
  ```

  The `executives` group is granted access only to resources that are tagged with both `team:marketing=true`
  and `PII=true`.

## Tag Strategy

There is no one-size-fits-all solution, the most effective strategy is the one that aligns best with an organization's
structure. The recommended strategies are a modified version of the
[AWS Recommended Common LF-Tag Ontologies](https://aws.github.io/aws-lakeformation-best-practices/lf-tags/common-ontologies/).

We suggest two strategies, pick the one that best fits your organization's structure:

- **Product-based tagging**: Tag resources based on the product/project they belong to and then create fine-grained
permission grants per principal/team. **Recommended for scenarios with many products and many teams**. This approach scales
with both products and team size but requires more effort in creating permission grants.

- **Team-based tagging**: Tag resources based on the team that needs access, assuming that it is acceptable that the same team tag will have
the same permission level to all resources they have access to. **Recommended for simplicity when you have many products but only a few
teams and can accept certain limitations.** This approach scales with the number of products but not the number of teams, due to the 50-tag limit on
resources.

Let's consider a scenario with the following teams and roles:
- `Admin` has the role `RoleAdmin`
- `DataEngineering` has the role `RoleDataEngineering`
- `DataScience` has the role `RoleDataScience`

We have the following products and their respective databases:
- `ProductA`: `Database1`, `Database2`
- `ProductB`: `Database3`

### Product-based tagging

This strategy involves tagging resources based on the product they belong to, followed by creating fine-grained
permission grants per team.

#### Suggested Tags
We suggest to start with a basic tagging strategy and limiting the number of tags:
- `product:<product_name> = true`: Tag resources belonging to a specific product.
- `sensitive = [true, false]`: Tag resources containing sensitive data (e.g., PII).

#### Resource Tagging
Start by tagging your resources, let's only apply them to Databases to keep things simple. Apply the following tags:
- `Database1`: `sensitive=false`, `product:productA=true`
- `Database2`: `sensitive=true`, `product:productA=true`
- `Database3`: `sensitive=false`, `product:productB=true`

#### Permissions
Admins need full access to all Databases, we don't have to specify the `senstive` tag as the value is irrelevant.
```sql
GRANT FULL ACCESS ON TAGS product:productA=true TO RoleAdmin
GRANT FULL ACCESS ON TAGS product:productB=true TO RoleAdmin
```

The following grants will allow the `DataEngineering` team full access to all Databases of all products that are not
sensitive. They will only be able to access `Database1` and `Database3`.
```sql
GRANT FULL ACCESS ON TAGS product:productA=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleDataEngineering
GRANT FULL ACCESS ON TAGS product:productB=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleDataEngineering
```

The `DataScience` team requires read only access to ProductB. So they can only access `Database3`.
```sql
GRANT READ ACCESS ON TAGS product:productB=true AND sensitive=true TO RoleDataScience
```

#### Pros and Cons

This approach is effective when there are only a few products or databases that need to be shared across multiple teams.
In this model, you assign a product tag to each resource once and then configure permission grants for every team that
requires access to the product.

**Advantages**:
- You do not need to add additional tags to resources.
- Permission grants can be tailored to each team's requirements.

**Disadvantages**:
- Creating permission grants for every team and product can become time-consuming and complex as the number of teams
and products increases.

**Example Scenario**:

Assume you have 100 products or databases and 5 teams. If the SalesTeam requires access to 50 of these products, the
following grants would need to be created:
```sql
GRANT READ ONLY ACCESS ON TAGS product:productA=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleSales
GRANT READ ONLY ACCESS ON TAGS product:productB=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleSales
... repeat for remaining 48 products
```

If a new product is introduced, you must also grant permissions to each relevant team. For example:
```sql
GRANT FULL ACCESS ON TAGS product:productNEW=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleDataEngineering
GRANT READONLY ACCESS ON TAGS product:productNEW=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleDataScience
GRANT READONLY ACCESS ON TAGS product:productNEW=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleSales
```

### Team based tagging

This strategy involves tagging resources based on the team that requires access. However, it is important to note that
all resources associated with the same team tag will share the same permission level.

#### Suggested Tags
We suggest to start with a basic tagging strategy and limiting the number of tags:
Here are the basic tags:
- `team:<team_name> = true`: Assigned to resources that a specific team should access.
- `sensitive = [true, false]`: Indicates whether a resource contains sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable
Information (PII).

#### Resource Tagging
Start by tagging your resources, let's only apply them to Databases to keep things simple. Apply the following tags,
assuming that we always have the `team:Admin=true` tag on all resources, as they must always have access to all
resources:
- `Database1` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`)
- `Database2` with tags (`sensitive=true`,  `team:Admin=true`)
- `Database3` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`)

#### Permissions
Since Admins need full access to all Databases, we don't have to specify the `senstive` tag as the value is irrelevant.
```sql
GRANT FULL ACCESS ON TAGS team:Admin=true TO RoleAdmin
```

For the `DataEngineering` team to have full access to all Databases that are not sensitive, we need to specify their
grants as:
```sql
GRANT FULL ACCESS ON TAGS team:DataEngineering=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleDataEngineering
```
But now we have to add tags to our resources, our Databases now look like:
- `Database1` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`)
- `Database2` with tags (`sensitive=true`,  `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`)
- `Database3` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`)

The `DataScience` team requires read only access to Database3.
```sql
GRANT READ ACCESS ON TAGS team:DataScience=true AND sensitive=false TO RoleDataScience
```
But again, we have to add tags to our resources, our Databases now look like:
- `Database1` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`)
- `Database2` with tags (`sensitive=true`,  `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`)
- `Database3` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`, `team:DataScience=true`)

#### Pros and Cons

:::caution
This strategy has scalability limitations. AWS enforces a 50-tag limit per resource, which means you cannot exceed 50
teams. Additionally, other tags such as `sensitive` count toward this limit, reducing the number of team tags you can use.
:::

This approach is effective when you need to share **many products or databases** with **a small number of teams** and
can accommodate the restriction that all resources with the same team tag share identical permissions. You define the
permission grant once for the team's tag and apply it to all resources requiring access.

**Advantages**:
- Reduces the need for multiple permission grants.
- Straightforward to manage with a limited number of teams.

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires tagging resources for each team, which can become cumbersome.
- Teams with the same tag will have identical permissions for all tagged resources.
- Limited scalability due to the 50-tag resource limit.

**Example Scenario**:

Consider a situation with 100 products or databases and 5 teams. If the `SalesTeam` requires access to 50 of these
products, you would need to update the tags on each database:
- `Database1` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`, `team:Sales=true`)
- `Database2` with tags (`sensitive=true`,  `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`, `team:Sales=true`)
- `Database3` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`, `team:DataScience=true`, `team:Sales=true`)
- ... repeat for remaining 47 products/databases

When introducing a new product or database, you must also update its tags for each relevant team:
- `DatabaseNEW` with tags (`sensitive=false`, `team:Admin=true`, `team:DataEngineering=true`, `team:Sales=true`)

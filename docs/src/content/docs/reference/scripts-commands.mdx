## Scripts

The DLZ provides utility functions that abstract the complexity of common tasks such as bootstrapping accounts across
regions, running CDK diff or deploy commands, setting cost allocation tags, and more.

These functions are exposed as static methods on the `Scripts` class and can be executed outside the CDK application,
either manually or as part of a pipeline. The `localProfile` property specifies the AWS CLI profile to use when
executing the scripts.

<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    const dlz = new DataLandingZone(app, {
    ...
      localProfile: 'YOUR_PROFILE,
    ...
  });
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    dlz.DataLandingZone(app,
    ...
    local_profile='YOUR_PROFILE',
    ...
    );
    ```
  </Fragment>
</DualCode>

### Scripts permission

For most commands, such as `diff` and `deploy`, the AWS profile (`localProfile`) used can operate with restricted permissions.
These scripts do not require full administrative access, allowing for a more restricted permissions model to
enhance security.

The `bootstrap` script, however, requires elevated permissions. The specified profile must have administrative access
to the root management account and the ability to assume the `AWSControlTowerExecution` role created by AWS
Control Tower. These permissions are highly privileged and should be handled with caution.

### TypeScript Usage

A complete example is available in the [TypeScript Example GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DataChefHQ/aws-data-landing-zone-example-typescript)

The code snippets below are from:
- [/scripts](https://github.com/DataChefHQ/aws-data-landing-zone-example-typescript/tree/main/scripts)
- [packge.josn](https://github.com/DataChefHQ/aws-data-landing-zone-example-typescript/tree/main/package.json)

There are many ways to run scripts in a TypeScript project. Here, weâ€™ll explore a simple and straightforward approach.
Start by creating a `scripts` directory at the root of your project, and add individual TypeScript files, each
containing the specific DLZ `Scripts` you want to execute.

```ts
// scripts/bootstrap.ts
import { Scripts } from 'aws-data-landing-zone';
import { config } from '../bin/minimum_config';

(async () => {
  await Scripts.boostrapAll(config);
})();
```

You can run the script using `npx ts-node`, which is typically included as a dev dependency in AWS CDK projects. To
simplify the process, add a corresponding script to your `package.json`.

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "bootstrap": "npx ts-node scripts/bootstrap.ts"
  }
}
```
You can then execute the script with `npm run bootstrap`. The `bootstrapAll` function reads the DLZ configuration,
including details such as AWS profiles, account IDs, and regions. It orchestrates the bootstrapping process for the
root, security audit, security log, and workload accounts, ensuring they all trust the root account.

#### Available Scripts

- `Scripts.boostrapAll(props: DataLandingZoneProps)` - Bootstraps all accounts (root, security audit, security log,
and workload accounts) in all regions.
- `Scripts.diffAll(props: DataLandingZoneProps)` - Runs `cdk diff "**"` to show differences for all stacks across all accounts and regions.
- `Scripts.diffSelect(props: DataLandingZoneProps, id: string)` - Runs `cdk diff "${id}"` to show differences for a selected stack using its ID.
- `Scripts.deployAll(props: DataLandingZoneProps)` - Deploys all stacks in all accounts and regions using `cdk deploy "**"`.
- `Scripts.deploySelect(props: DataLandingZoneProps, id: string)` - Deploys a selected stack using `cdk deploy "${id}"`.
- `Scripts.configureCostAllocationTags(props: DataLandingZoneProps)` - Sets the `mandatoryTags` and
  `additionalMandatoryTags` properties as cost allocation tags.


More examples and pre-configured scripts are available in the
[TypeScript Example GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DataChefHQ/aws-data-landing-zone-example-typescript). These can
be copied and reused in your project. They contain pre-configured scripts for the most common stack
selecting ids for the `Scripts.diffSelect` and `Scripts.deploySelect` functions.

Refer to the [Stack Patterns](/components/build-system/deployment-order#stacks-patterns) section for a full list of stack selecting IDs.

### Python Usage

## Commands (manual)

:::tip[Use Scripts when possible]
The [Scripts](#scripts) are a higher level abstraction that can be used to manage the DLZ. They are easier to use and understand.
:::

The [Scripts](#scripts) abstraction simplifies DLZ tasks and is recommended for most use cases. However, manual
commands are detailed below for reference or troubleshooting purposes.

### Bootstrap

Each account and region defined in the DLZ configuration must be CDK bootstrapped. This process is automated by the
`Scripts.boostrapAll` function. For manual execution, use the following steps:

Script replacements:
- `YOUR_PROFILE` - The AWS CLI profile to use. See required permission as mentioned in [Scripts permission](#scripts-permission).
- `ROOT_ACCOUNT_ID` - The AWS Account ID of the root management account. All other accounts will trust this account.
- `SECURITY_LOG_ACCOUNT_ID` - The AWS Account ID of the security log account.
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_ACCOUNT_ID` - The AWS Account ID of the security log account.
- `GLOBAL_REGION` - The region where the management account is located.
- `REGIONS` - The list of other regions to bootstrap.
- `WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_IDS` - The list of account IDs to bootstrap.

```bash
GLOBAL_REGION="GLOBAL_REGION"
REGIONS=(
  "REGIONS")

ACCOUNTS=(
  "SECURITY_LOG_ACCOUNT_ID"
  "SECURITY_AUDIT_ACCOUNT_ID"
  "WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_IDS")

cdk bootstrap --cloudformation-execution-policies arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --profile $YOUR_PROFILE --tags Owner=infra --tags Project=dlz --tags Environment=dlz aws://$ROOT_ACCOUNT_ID/$GLOBAL_REGION

for account in "${ACCOUNTS[@]}"; do

  ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::$account:role/AWSControlTowerExecution"
  SESSION_NAME="CDKBootstrap"
  ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT=$(aws sts assume-role --profile $YOUR_PROFILE --role-arn $ROLE_ARN --role-session-name $SESSION_NAME)

  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo $ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT | jq -r '.Credentials.AccessKeyId')
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo $ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT | jq -r '.Credentials.SecretAccessKey')
  AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(echo $ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT | jq -r '.Credentials.SessionToken')
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN

  cdk bootstrap --cloudformation-execution-policies arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --trust $ROOT_ACCOUNT_ID --tags Owner=infra --tags Project=dlz --tags Environment=dlz aws://$account/$GLOBAL_REGION
  for region in "${REGIONS[@]}"; do
    cdk bootstrap --cloudformation-execution-policies arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess --trust $ROOT_ACCOUNT_ID --tags Owner=infra --tags Project=dlz --tags Environment=dlz aws://$account/$region
  done
done
```


### Diff

The cdk diff command compares the current state of stacks with the code definition.
This process is automated by the `Scripts.diffAll` and `Scripts.diffSelect` functions.
For manual execution, see the following examples:

Below are a few examples of how to run the diff command manually.
```bash
# To diff all the stacks in all accounts and regions.
cdk diff "**" --profile YOUR_PROFILE
# To diff all the stacks in all accounts and regions in the "root" phase.
cdk diff "root--*" --exclusively --profile YOUR_PROFILE
# To diff all the stacks in the workload phase of type development (specified in the config by type: DlzAccountType.DEVELOP)
cdk diff "*_development--*_*" --exclusively --profile YOUR_PROFILE
```

Refer to the [Stack Patterns](/components/build-system/deployment-order#stacks-patterns) section for a full list of stack selecting IDs.

### Deploy

The CDK deploy command deploys the stacks defined in the CDK code.
This process is automated by the `Scripts.deployAll` and `Scripts.deploySelect` functions.
For manual execution, see the following examples:

```bash
# To deploy all the stacks in all accounts and regions.
cdk deploy "**" --require-approval never --progress events --concurrency 10 --profile ct-sandbox-exported
# To deploy all the stacks in all accounts and regions in the "root" phase.
cdk deploy "root--*" --require-approval never --progress events --concurrency 10 --exclusively --profile ct-sandbox-exported
# To deploy all the stacks in the workload phase of type development (specified in the config by type: DlzAccountType.DEVELOP)
cdk deploy "*_development--*_*" --require-approval never --progress events --concurrency 10 --exclusively --profile ct-sandbox-exported
```

Refer to the [Stack Patterns](/components/build-system/deployment-order#stacks-patterns) section for a full list of stack selecting IDs.

### Configure Cost Allocation Tags

Manually set cost allocation tags using the following script:

```bash
TAGS=("Tag1" "Tag2")
TAGS_JSON=$(printf ',{"Key":"%s","Status":"ACTIVE"}' "${TAGS[@]}")
TAGS_JSON="[${TAGS_JSON:1}]"
aws ce update-cost-allocation-tags-status --cost-allocation-tags-statuses "$TAGS_JSON"
```

The `Scripts.configureCostAllocationTags` script sets the `mandatoryTags` and `additionalMandatoryTags`
properties as cost allocation tags.

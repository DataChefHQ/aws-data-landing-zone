The Data Landing Zone provides opinionated yet configurable setups by offering optional defaults for various
parts of the configuration. These defaults help streamline setup while remaining adaptable to specific requirements.

### Example: Using Defaults in Budgets

An example of applying defaults is demonstrated in the [Budgets](/components/account-management/budgets#defaults)
component, where the `Defaults.budgets` object is used to create two standard budgets.

Below is a code snippet illustrating how to configure a budget of $100 for the entire organization and $20 for
resources created by the DLZ:

<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    import {App} from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    import { DataLandingZone } from 'aws-data-landing-zone';

    const app = new App();
    const dlz = new DataLandingZone(app, {
      budgets: [
        ...Defaults.budgets(100, 20, {
          emails: ['you@org.com'],
        }),
      ],
     ...
    });
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    import aws_cdk as cdk
    import aws_data_landing_zone as dlz

    app = cdk.App()
    dlz.DataLandingZone(app,
            budgets=[
                *dlz.Defaults.budgets(
                    100,
                    20,
                    emails=["you@org.com"],
                ),
            ],
        ...
    )

    ```
  </Fragment>
</DualCode>

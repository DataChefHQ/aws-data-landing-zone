A Network Address is a unique identifier for a network resource, such as a VPC, subnet, or route table. These addresses
work across accounts and regions, allowing for easy selection and addressing of network resources. A Network Address
is used when defining VPC bound resources in the DLZ, like NATs, Bastion Hosts, VPC Peering etc.

Network Addresses are weekly typed strings that has the following schema:
```
<account-name>.<region>.<vpc-name>.<route-table-name>.<subnet-name>
```

Examples of specifying a Network Addresses:
<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    /* As a string */
    NetworkAddress.fromString("account.region.vpc.route-table.subnet")
    /* Using the class constructor */
    new NetworkAddress('account', 'region', 'vpc', 'route-table', 'subnet')
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    # As a string
    NetworkAddress.from_string("account.region.vpc.route-table.subnet")
    # Using the class constructor
    NetworkAddress('account', 'region', 'vpc', 'route-table', 'subnet')
    ```
  </Fragment>
</DualCode>


This schema allows us to select various network entities, where a network entity is defined as one or more an accounts,
vpcs, regions, subnets or subnets. This enables selections like:

- `development.us-east-1.default.private.private-1`: Selects a specific private subnet in the default VPC in the
development account in the us-east-1 region.
- `development.us-east-1.default.private`: Select all the private subnets in the default VPC in the development
account in the us-east-1 region.
- `development.us-east-1.default`: Select all the route tables and all their respective subnets in the default
VPC in the development account in the us-east-1 region.
- `development.us-east-1`: Select all the VPCs and their respective route tables and subnets in the development
account in the us-east-1 region.
- `development`: Select all the VPCs, route tables and subnets in the development account in all the regions.

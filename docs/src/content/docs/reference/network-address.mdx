A Network Address uniquely identifies a network resource, such as a VPC, subnet, or route table. These addresses can
be used across accounts and regions, enabling seamless selection and referencing of network resources. They are
commonly used when defining VPC-bound resources in the DLZ, like NATs, Bastion Hosts, VPC Peering, etc.

Network Addresses are weakly typed strings that follow the schema below:
```
<account-name>.<region>.<vpc-name>.<route-table-name>.<subnet-name>
```

### Examples of Network Address Usage

<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    /* As a string */
    NetworkAddress.fromString("account.region.vpc.route-table.subnet")
    /* Using the class constructor */
    new NetworkAddress('account', 'region', 'vpc', 'route-table', 'subnet')
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    # As a string
    NetworkAddress.from_string("account.region.vpc.route-table.subnet")
    # Using the class constructor
    NetworkAddress('account', 'region', 'vpc', 'route-table', 'subnet')
    ```
  </Fragment>
</DualCode>


This schema allows you to select various network entities. A network entity is defined as one or more accounts, VPCs,
regions, or subnets. Below are examples of possible selections:

- `development.us-east-1.default.private.private-1`: Selects a specific private subnet in the default VPC within the
development account in the us-east-1 region.
- `development.us-east-1.default.private`: Selects all private subnets in the default VPC within the development
account in the us-east-1 region.
- `development.us-east-1.default`: Selects all route tables and their associated subnets in the default VPC within the
development account in the us-east-1 region.
- `development.us-east-1`: Selects all VPCs, along with their route tables and subnets, within the development account
in the us-east-1 region.
- `development`: Selects all VPCs, route tables, and subnets across all regions within the development account.

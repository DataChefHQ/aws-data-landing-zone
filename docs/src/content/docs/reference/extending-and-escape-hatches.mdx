The Data Landing Zone provides the flexibility to customize and extend stacks and their constructs. This section explains
how to extend the Data Landing Zone and use escape hatches to modify default behavior.

## Extending the Data Landing Zone

All stacks are accessible through the DLZ construct, enabling the addition or removal of constructs from these stacks.

Below is an example showing how to add an SNS topic to the management stack:

<DualCode>
  <Fragment slot="ts">
    ```ts
    import {App} from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    import { DataLandingZone } from 'aws-data-landing-zone';

    const app = new App();
    const dlz = new DataLandingZone(app, { ... });

    const topic = new sns.Topic(dlz.managementStack, "new-topic", {
      displayName: "new-topic",
      topicName: "new-topic",
    });
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="python">
    ```python
    import aws_cdk as cdk
    from aws_data_landing_zone import DataLandingZone
    from aws_cdk import aws_sns as sns

    app = cdk.App()
    dlz = DataLandingZone(app, ... )

    topic = sns.Topic(dlz.management_stack, "new-topic",
                      display_name="new-topic",
                      topic_name="new-topic")
    ```
  </Fragment>
</DualCode>

## Escape Hatches

Constructs can be accessed and customized using common CDK [escape hatches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cfn_layer.html).
These include Aspects, using the `node` property, and the `addOverride` method.

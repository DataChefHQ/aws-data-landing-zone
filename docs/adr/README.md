# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

### What is ADRs?
> An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement
> that is architecturally significant. An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a
> measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture and quality. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a
> single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained
> in a project constitute its decision log. All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM).
